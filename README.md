# md-cv

A (jekyll-based) markdown CV tweaked slightly from the great design by [elipapa](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv) (see their [blog post](http://www.eliseopapa.org/workflow/2012/09/20/why-i-switched-to-markdown-for-my-cv/)).

Note the seperate print and screen CSS, my approach was to build a pretty colourful html version and a toned-down print version (for PDF). My changes introduce CSS3 multi-columns which currently don't print to PDF under the blink/webkit engines, so to print properly I suggest firefox.
