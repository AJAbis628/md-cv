# md-cv

A (jekyll-based) markdown CV tweaked slightly from the great design by [elipapa](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv) (see their [blog post](http://www.eliseopapa.org/workflow/2012/09/20/why-i-switched-to-markdown-for-my-cv/)).

To build, clone the repo and run jekyll:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/blmoore/md-cv
cd md-cv/
jekyll serve
```

Then point your browser at [0.0.0.0:4000](0.0.0.0:4000).

### HTML version

The HTML version is generated by Jekyll under `_site` using `media/cv-screen.css`. Most changes from the original repo are artificial:

* fixed horizontal scrolling issue caused by lots of funky CSS positioning (lots of `left` etc.)
* messed with colours, fonts
* now imports font-awesome icons and Open sans

### PDF version

Note the separate CSS for print and screen media (see `media/cv-print.css`), my approach was to build a somewhat "jazzy" html version and a toned-down print version (for PDF). My changes introduce CSS3 columns in some sections which currently don't print to PDF under the blink/webkit engines (as of March 2015), so to print properly I suggest firefox.

### todo

Some of the links are borked in the PDF version (all except the mailtos, hmm). I don't know where to start fixing this, how are links even handled within PDFs? No idea.
