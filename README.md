# md-cv
My academic CV, written in markdown for PDF and the web.

To start with, the CSS was taken directly from [davidhampgonsalves](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/resume)'s resume which in turn uses [md2resume](https://github.com/there4/markdown-resume). The actual CSS used by md2resume is under `node_module/assets/css` (e.g. on OSX global install: `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/markdown-resume/assets/css`) so may be out of sync with the css attached in this repo.
