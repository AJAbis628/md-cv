### Education

**PhD Bioinformatics** (2012-15) *University of Edinburgh*
  During my PhD I analysed a diverse array of publicly-available biological datasets to uncover new insights into the epigenetics underlying higher-order chromatin stucture. I integrated Hi-C and other chromosome conformation capture experimental results with... My PhD was supervised by Colin A. Semple and Stuart Aitken in the MRC Human Genetics Unit, IGMM.
**MSc Bioinformatics and theoretical systems biology** (2011-12) *Imperial College London*
  My MSc included both taught (statistics, programming and biology) components, as well as three research projects. These included a software engineering project where I helped develop a stochastic Petri net library in Python with Prof. Michael Stumpf ([Sputnik](https://github.com/sputnikpetrinets)), and another project (since [published](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.23330)) in which I applied Guassian mixture modelling to a long-standing problem in structural bioinformatics.
  **Grade:** Distinction
**BSc Biology** (2008-11) *University of York*
  **Grade:** First class honours

### Placements

**Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute**, Cambridge.
During my undergraduate degree I spent two summers working in Alex Bateman's group on the [Rfam](http://rfam.xfam.org/) database and supporting materials. Here we used covariance models to build non-coding RNA families

### Projects

* **EdinbR**
	I co-founded a usergroup for the R programming language in Edinburgh called EdinbR. I help to organise our monthly meetings and run our website: [edinbr.org](http://edinbr.org). Our meetings attract tens of statisticians, data scientists and developers to for talks and discussion around the R language and its applications.

* **Summer Data Challenge**
	I entered Imperial College's [Summer Data Challenge](http://summerdatachallenge.com/) competition, where entrants analysed a given dataset and then proposed a startup idea based on their results. I developed a modelling technique to select housing areas for investment and was awarded third place: £2,000 and startup support from Imperial Create Lab.

* **Blog**
	I author a data science blog at [blm.io](http://blm.io) where I apply R and python to open datasets and write-up the results. My posts have been picked up by sites including FiveThirtyEight, BuzzFeed, AVclub and more, and also led to being an invited blogger at the Huffington Post.
